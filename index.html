        <!-- <h4>a TWO-N Project</h4> -->
        <p class="text">There is no arguing that Beyonc&#233 is a wildly accomplished singer, songwriter and performer. She's got a hoard of GRAMMYs to prove it, and a hive-full of fans who rightfully adore her. But would you -or anyone you know - call her a rapper?

        These questions first came to me while listening to Megan Thee Stallion's Savage Remix. I had a real record-scratch moment. How did I breeze by the fact that Beyonc&#233 is really rapping on this song? Is she flying under the radar as a rapper because she is such an accomplished singer?</p>

        <!-- ADD INTRO BLURB -->
        <p class="text">I set out to investigate:
          <ol class="indent text">
            <strong>
              <li>Is Beyonc&#233 a (low-key) rapper?</li>
              <li>Is her rap music more or less popular?</ol> </li>
            </strong>

The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. <strong>Album popularity</strong> is derived mathematically from track popularity.
           <strong> Percent Rap</strong> of the album is found by dividing the number of tracks featuring Beyonc&#233 rapping by the total number of tracks on the album.</p> </i>

      <p class="text">If dedicating over 65% of the songs on her latest two albums is not enough to crossover into rap artist territory, I'm not sure what is. But to be thorough, I set out to examine songs outside studio albums which showcase Beyonc&#233 rapping. Here's what I uncovered.</p>

      <p class="text">Spotify popularity takes recency of a stream into account.  Theoretically a more recent album will be higher ranked in popularity. While that ultimately shows whether music stands the test of time, I was curious to see if how my questions would be answered using another metric for popularity.

        <p class="text">As for the question of popularity, I expected to see an inverse relationship between rap content and popularity, but the reality is more nuanced than that. On the Billboard Charts and at the GRAMMYs Beyonc&#233 seems to be slightly less celebrated as a rapper. RENAISSANCE act I seems to be universally popular.
        The ultimate conclusion is that we have enjoyed 20 years of Beyonc&#233's contributions to music and she keeps raising the bar. Whether it's with her gorgeous singing voice or these sneaky BARS.</p>

        <p class="text">No matter what we hear from the Queen next, we're lucky to be living in a time when Beyonc&#233 is Beyonc&#233-ing this hard. </p>
