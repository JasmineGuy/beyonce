      <span class="subtitle">Is Beyoncé <strong class="highlight">Secretly </strong>a Rapper?</span>
      <h4>a TWO-N Project</h4>
      <p class="text">There is no arguing that Beyoncé is a wildly accomplished singer, songwriter and performer. She's got a hoard of GRAMMYs to prove it, and a hive-full of fans who rightfully adore her. But would you -or anyone you know - call her a rapper? </p>

      <!-- ADD INTRO BLURB -->
      <p>I had two pressing questions that warranted investigation:
        <ol>
          <strong>
            <li>Is Beyoncé a rapper? In other words: Did she sneak a rap crossover in under our noses? </li>
            <li>Is her rap music more or less popular?</ol> </li>
          </strong>
      </p>
    <div> I listened to her entire body of work to make a determination.</div>

          <p class="subscript"> <strong>How to read:</strong> Studio albums are plotted over time. Each ring around an album represents a track which features Beyoncé rapping. Ex. 2 Rings = 2 rap features. Music notes represent singles.</p>
          <p class="subscript"> <strong>How to interact:</strong> Select a metric to compare Beyoncé albums/songs over time. Hover for additional details. Click a track or single to play a 30-second sample (courtesy of Spotify). To stop playback, click again, or use audio controls which will scroll as you do.</p>
          <p class="subscript"><i>Note: The <strong> spotify popularity</strong> of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. <strong>Album popularity</strong> is derived mathematically from track popularity</i></p>
          <p class="subscript"><i>Note: <strong> Percent Rap</strong> of the album is found by dividing the number of tracks featuring Beyoncé rapping by the total number of tracks on the album. Percent rap metrics don't exist for individual songs.</p>

      <p>If dedicating over 65% of the songs on an album to doesn't merit being acknowledged as a rapper, could you be persuaded to examine songs which were <i>not</i> released on studio albums that <i>also</i> feature Beyoncé rapping? Well here's your chance. This is the same chart and the same timeline, overlaid with lesser-known instances of Beyoncé rapping.</p>

      <span class="subtitle">Another Way to Determine Popularity</span>
      <p>Spotify popularity* takes recency of a stream into account.  Theoretically a more recent album will be higher ranked in popularity. While that ultimately shows whether music stands the test of time, I was curious to see if how my questions would be answered using another metric for popularity. So I looked into Billboard Hot 100 data. I asked the same questions: Is Beyoncé a rapper? Are rap songs more or less popular? </p>

            <li>Songs from<strong class="highlight"> <i>Lemonade</i> and <i>Renaissance</i></strong> all debut and peak as clusters - a response to surprise releases, perhaps?</li>

      <span class="subtitle">Conclusion</span>
      <!-- <div class="line"></div> -->
      <p>Queen Bey is clearly leaning into rap as a form of personal expression. The ability to do so has evidently been there since at least 2001 (in MTVs Carmen: A Hip Hopera), but the volume is certainly cranked lately. I, for one, won't mind if she continues to turn the volume up. As for its effect on her popularity, the jury is still out. With Renaissance breaking streaming records and being comprised of her most rap tracks to date, we have to wait and see. But if Renaissance act II is a full rap album, don't say you weren't warned. Either way we're lucky to be living in a time when Beyoncé is Beyoncé-ing this hard. </p>
