        <div class="credit">a TWO-N Project by Jasmine Guy</div>
        <p class="text">There is no arguing that Beyonc&#233 is a wildly accomplished singer, songwriter and performer. She's got a hoard of Grammys to prove it, and a hive-full of fans who rightfully adore her. But would you consider her a rapper? I jokingly told a friend that Beyonc&#233 was my favorite rapper and I was met with a strong side eye. Which got me thinking: why doesn't Beyonc&#233 get credit for rapping? As a long-time Beyonc&#233 fan, I felt uniquely qualified to point out how she has tiptoed into the genre over the course of her career.
        But since we live in a society that likes evidence, I decided to formally investigate the following questions by listening to her entire body of work. You know, hard-core data science?

          <p class="text">It's apparent that Beyonc&#233 is out here rapping, a fact that has been hiding in plain sight for some time now. So, the next time someone asks you to name your favorite rapper, don't hesitate to mention Beyonc&#233 and show the receipts. </p>

          <p class="text">While she's had plenty of success on the Billboard charts and at the GRAMMYs, her rap contributions seem to be slightly lesser known/popular. This may be because the composition of many of her songs still leans on her singing talent or that she released many of her rap features outside of studio albums.
